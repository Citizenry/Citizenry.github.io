Welcome to the official Citizenry Technology blog! This is where we'll share updates about our mission to build essential Internet services that are democratically moderated and managed by members.

## Our Mission

Citizenry allows for the citizenship of users regardless of physical location. With the shift of people online connected all the time to devices, it is time to reassess how all the related data and moderation are managed. 

We believe the traditional model of raising millions from Venture Capitalists to build for-profit social platforms is fundamentally flawed. This leads to over-centralization of control, features, and moderation, along with privacy and security issues of being part of the surveillance economy.

## What You'll Find Here

In this blog, we'll share:

- Updates on our open source projects
- Technical insights and tutorials
- Community highlights and stories
- Discussions about digital rights and democracy
- Announcements about new services and features

## Get Involved

All of our projects are open source and available on our [GitHub](https://github.com/Citizenry). We welcome contributions, feedback, and collaboration from the community.

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue building a more democratic and user-controlled internet!
